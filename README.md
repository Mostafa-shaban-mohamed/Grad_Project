"S.E.E.S" stands for Smart Educational Environment System, which is my Graduation Project for My Senior Year. I'm Responsible for LMS of this System. A Learning Management System implements a specific e-learning process. It provides an instructor with a way to create and deliver content, monitor student participation and assess student performance.

<h1>Description</h1>
<p>
S.E.E.S is whole smart environment system that helps the educational process to implements e-learning process. It consists of LMS (Learning Management System),
Bus Tracker (To track and pursue institution's busses), Attendance Device (To take students attendance without human interference) and Mobile application (To help in tracking and attendance).
</p>
<p>
In This part, we will discuss LMS. This LMS helps you manage administration, tracking, reporting and delivering of courses, lessons and tests.
As the primary role of a learning management system is to deliver learning to students, typically, there will be three different types of log-in
(there could be more, depending on your solution). These would usually be an admin log-in, a instructor log-in, and a student log-in.
</p>
<p>
The admin log-in will be for administrators; when logged in, it will present the user with the tools to be able to add content and users,
remove content and users, and allow users access to certain areas of the learning management system so that they can change settings.
</p>
<p>
The teacher log-in will allow teachers to assign work, receive completed work and results from students, and also create courses
</p>
<p>
The student log-in will present the user with information regarding courses, outstanding work and links to resources.
It will usually provide a way of contacting the instructors if they have any questions. Work can be submitted from the student log-in
